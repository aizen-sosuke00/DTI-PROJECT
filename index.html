    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Book Explorer is a web-based application developed as part of our Design Thinking and Innovation coursework. The project aims to solve a common challenge faced by readers—particularly students—who want to discover books in a simple, visual, and genre-specific way. Our solution offers an aesthetically pleasing, responsive website that allows users to explore a variety of book genres, each displayed on dedicated pages. Clicking on a genre opens a new tab with book cover previews, and clicking a cover opens a sample or preview PDF for that book. The website features a magical, Harry Potter–inspired dark theme with a starry night background to make the browsing experience immersive and unique. Functionality like hover effects, sub-genres (e.g., Programming → Python), and mobile responsiveness are designed to enhance user engagement and accessibility. Ultimately, Book Explorer is more than a website—it’s an experience designed to inspire reading through discovery and visual interaction.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In today's digital landscape, discovering books online can be surprisingly frustrating—especially for students and casual readers who aren’t sure what they’re looking for. Most online libraries or book platforms are cluttered, text-heavy, and lack intuitive ways to explore new genres or titles. Users often face challenges like endless scrolling, minimal visual engagement, and difficulty filtering books by interest areas. Based on our user research, we identified a significant gap: there is no central, user-friendly, and visually appealing platform that allows readers to explore books by genre with ease. This leads to missed opportunities for discovery, reduced reading engagement, and user dissatisfaction. Our problem statement became clear:
“Readers, especially students, struggle to find engaging and relevant books online due to a lack of a centralized, visual, and interactive browsing experience.”</p>

    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>To understand the needs, preferences, and frustrations of our target users, we conducted user research through surveys, interviews, and informal observation. Our primary audience included college students, casual readers, and tech-savvy learners. A digital survey shared across college groups yielded responses from over 30 participants. Key insights revealed that most users prefer visual browsing (such as book covers), want to filter books by genre or subject, and often feel lost on text-heavy library websites. Interviews further uncovered that users dislike endless scrolling and value quick previews to help them decide whether a book interests them. Accessibility on mobile devices and a clean interface were also repeatedly mentioned as expectations. This research shaped our design decisions and confirmed the need for a visually interactive, genre-driven book discovery platform. The empathy map and journey map developed from this phase helped define pain points and highlight opportunities for innovation.</p>
